Agricultural Crop Prediction Project

Overview
This project focuses on predicting agricultural crop yields using various data inputs such as rainfall, soil composition, and fertilizer usage. It leverages artificial intelligence for predictive analysis and incorporates blockchain technology to develop a decentralized application.

Key Features:

Predictive Analysis: Utilizes AI to analyze data and predict crop yields.
Soil Fertility Testing: Includes a model for assessing soil fertility.
Blockchain Integration: Implements blockchain to ensure decentralized and secure data handling.
Web Development: Combines Django for the backend and React for the frontend to create a robust and scalable web application.

Project Structure
Backend: The backend is developed using Django, providing a robust and scalable API for data handling and model integration.
Frontend: The frontend is built using React, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.
Machine Learning: Two distinct machine learning models are integrated:
Crop Yield Prediction: Predicts the yield based on input data.
Soil Fertility Testing: Assesses the fertility of the soil to provide insights for better crop management.
Blockchain: Utilizes blockchain technology to create a decentralized application for secure and transparent data management.
